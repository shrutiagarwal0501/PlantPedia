# 🌿 PlantPedia

**PlantPedia** is a web-based plant identification system using Deep Learning technique - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize plant species from uploaded images. The system is designed to provide fast, accurate predictions, along with educational insights on identified plants. PlantPedia have 95.5% accuracy and is trained on 85 Indian Species, taken from DIMSAR dataset, which is India's one and only official dataset by indian scientists.
